This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen, the Spots site. This site is designed for different users to create and edit their profiles while uploading images and small titles for their "Spots".

This project highlights the mastery of HTML and CSS concepts, while utilizing Figma as our project overview. Another highlight of this project was adaptive web design, where the focus was making sure the site worked on different browsers ranging from 320px to greater than 1440px width.

## Project Features

- Semantic HTML5

## Plan on improving the project

Future implementations could be focused on user-friendly animations and different themes for users. Another useful feature could be drop-down areas under each image/card for more user-inputted text area.
